## Spring 22A. Extra tables. Relations 1:1. Foreign Key Approach

- 1:1 mapping
- one `main entity`
- one `related entity`
- `main entity` contains extra filed to reference on `related entity`
- **1** `main entity` can have relation with **1** `related entity`
- possible `nulls`, because may be no `related entity` connected to `main entity`
