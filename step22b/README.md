## Spring 22B. Extra tables. Relations 1:1. Shared Primary Key Approach

- 1:1 mapping
- one `main entity`
- one `related entity`
- `main entity` **does not** contain extra filed to reference on `related entity`
- there is `PK` of `related entity`
- `PK` on `related entity` called `main_id`
- `PK` (`main_id`) on `related entity` uses `PK` from `main entity` (Shared Primary Key Approach)
