## Spring 22C. Extra tables. Relations 1:1. Extra (3rd) Table Join Approach 

- 1:1 mapping
- one `main entity` with unique `PK`
- one `related entity` with unique `PK`
- `main entity` **does not** contain extra filed to reference on `related entity`
- `related entity` **does not** contain extra filed to reference on `main entity`
- **1** `main entity` can have relation with **1** `related entity`
- we have 3-rd table to handle relations between `main entity` and `related entity`
